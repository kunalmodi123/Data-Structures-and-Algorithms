MCM -> string or array given
say,
we are given two indices i(left end index) and j(right end index)
we have to take an index k(middle index) in between
and break the problem into two problems
e.g. 
          func(i, j)
temp ans /         \ temp ans
    func(i, k)    func(k+1, j)

then we will get temporary ans from the below subproblems and 
then we will calculate the required answer by applying any 
function to the temporary ans

* for base case, think for the "invalid input"
