In problems related to stack, generally an input array is given.

Try to fing the brute force solution of the problem if,
1> the time complexity is O(n^2) and
2> the for loops are dependent for e.g,
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        for(int j =i+1 ; j < n;j++)
        {
            //code
        }
    }

then there is a possibilty that we can use STACK and reduce the time complexity
to about O(n)
